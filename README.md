# CPP_Nanodegree
Repository for the C++ Nanodegree program 

In this nanodegree, I learned about the basic and advanced features of the C++ language. 

Some of the basics include: variable declarations, vectors and A* search algorithm

It then advances on to the more advanced concepts such as Object oriented programming, memory management and concurrency.
